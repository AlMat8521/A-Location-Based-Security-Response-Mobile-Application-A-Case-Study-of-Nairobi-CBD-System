Abstract

This thesis addresses the challenge of real-time reporting and response to security incidences in Nairobi, Kenya. It proposes a location-based mobile application to facilitate easy reporting of crimes to police stations and the assignment of on-duty officers to cases. The system aims to enhance accountability, transparency, and response times, leveraging GPS technology to manage real-time reporting, response, and criminal activity management within Nairobi. The study employs the Scrum methodology for agile development, ensuring continuous stakeholder engagement and improvement.
